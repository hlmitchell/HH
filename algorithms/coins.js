// Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...

// They found out you're a programmer and asked you to solve something they've been wondering for a long time.

// Write a function that, given:

// an amount of money
// an array of coin denominations
// computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

// Example: for amount=4 (4¢) and denominations=[1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would 
// output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:

function coinsum() {

}

coinsum();
