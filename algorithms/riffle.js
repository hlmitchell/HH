// I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single riffle. â†´

// To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffledDeck is a 
// single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.

// We'll represent a stack of cards as an array of integers in the range 1..521..52 
// (since there are 5252 distinct cards in a deck).
